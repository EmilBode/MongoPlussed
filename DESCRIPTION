Title: Extensions of Mongolite Package
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Emil", "Bode", email = "Emil.Bode@dans.knaw.nl", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Extra interfaces for working with a mongo-database. It is largely based on the mongolite package by Jeroen Ooms, but contains some extensions: Script for creating and accessing mongo-dbs in a docker-container, and for simplifying querying in nested documents. And it hides less of the internals, so you can more easily write own extensions, and also use methods from the RMongo-package.
